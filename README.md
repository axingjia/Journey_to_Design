# Journey_to_Design

This is a notetaking repo for anything design. UI design, UX design, graphic design.

## UX Design

* Books: [Don't Make me Think: A common Sense Approach to Web Usability, by Steve Krug](https://www.amazon.ca/Dont-Make-Think-Revisited-Usability-ebook/dp/B00HJUBRPG/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=don%27t+make+me+think&qid=1594675115&sr=8-1), [Lean UX: Applying Lean Principles 7to Improve User Experience by jeff Gothelf, Josh Seiden](https://www.amazon.ca/Lean-UX-Designing-Great-Products-ebook/dp/B01LYGQ6CH/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2MSSN8WMNZMJE&dchild=1&keywords=lean+ux&qid=1594675180&sprefix=lean+UX%2Caps%2C208&sr=8-1), [Smashing UX Design: Foundations for Designing ONline User Experiences, by Jesmond Allen, James Chudley](https://www.amazon.ca/Smashing-Design-Foundations-Designing-Experiences/dp/0470666854/ref=sr_1_1?crid=MBN11AGAZW3E&dchild=1&keywords=smashing+ux+design&qid=1594675246&sprefix=Smashing+UX+design%2Caps%2C284&sr=8-1), [The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman](https://www.amazon.ca/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded/dp/B07L5TBRRG/ref=sr_1_1?crid=Q58VZNOCLYFW&dchild=1&keywords=design+of+everyday+things&qid=1594675367&sprefix=design+of+ever%2Caps%2C207&sr=8-1)
* What is Design by Dieter Rams: Innovative, useful, aesthetic, understandable, unobstrusive, honest, long-lasting, thorough and thoughtful, environmentally friendly, less is more
* There is no such thing as an objectively good user interface: quality depends on the context: who the user is, what he/she is doing, what their motivation are; 2. Applying a set of one-size-fits-all principles makes user interface creation easier, but it **doesn't necessarily make the end result better**
* Bad design is easier to spot than good design: We mostly don't notice the good design--only when it's bad

## Startup and Entrepreneurship
* Entrepreneur: Entrepreneurship is the pursuit of opportunity without regard to resources currentrly controlled. Howard Stevenson, Process of starting a business or an organization-done by an entrepreneur, process: develop business model, acquire resources; design, build, iterate
* A startup is an idea in search of a business model. 2. Newly created, in a phase of development and research for a given market; 3. There's also lean startup, idea created by Eric Ries in 2011, an attempt as shortening the process by validating the product early. 4. Business-hypothesis-driven experimentation; iterative product releases; validated learning--try idea, measure effectiveness
* Startup common mistake: 1. building before validating, 2. creating a solution and then looking for a problem for it; 3. Not identifying who the customer/user is; 4. Not checking whether it's feasible or not
* Value Proposition: In order to create a startup, need an idea: formalize the idea with a value proposition
* Value Proposition; A promise of value a customer/user will receive by choosing your product/service over others; 2. explain how product/service solves customer problems; 3. has a headline, sub-headline(or a two-to-three sentence paragraph); 4. list benefits and/or features
* Don't be "better", "faster", "cooler", be unique
* Example: K-12 student who receive awards such as sport trophies and graduate certificates record the moment with photos and trophies which don't always capture the feeling, detail, or personalization of the event. Memento 3D creates photorealistic 3D sculptures of your children in their moment of celebration such as winning the tournament, being the most valuable player, or graduating. Memento 3D records on location and ships your three dimensional rendition to you; offering a keepsake that will immortalize the moment in a way that a photograph or trophy can never do.

## Validating Assumption
* "People don't want to buy a quarter--inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole!"--Theodore Levitt, American economist, professor at Harvard Business School
* Why validate: Making new products is based on assumptions(Your assumption may be wrong; try and poke holes in it); 2. will save you money and time-if you are wrong(fail fast, fail often); 3. get you in touch with you users; 4. will help you figure out if you have something of value to others.
* Validate: 1. market/demand (need to ensure a large enough demand. ie.solve a big enough problem); 2. Problem/pain point (find real users--don't use family/friends); 3. product: final step, iterative
* How to validate? 1. Talk to potential customers: real users--not family/friends; informal interview, ask lots of open ended questions; look for patterns, how do they address (if at all) pain point; 2. Create landing page: website that attracts potential users: use google adwords, facebook ads, etc. to draw potential users in; use analytics to track potential user interest; 3. industry reports; 4. Look at competitor offering: and try and make accurate guess of pricing/revenue numbers; 5. Look at traffic for competing sites/products; 6. use search trends (e.g., Google Trends) to see interest; 7. Build a minimum viable product (MVP): Highest ROI vs risk, core features, nothing fancy; 8. Set up minimum criteria for success: e.g., "I expect x number of people out of the y number of people in the experiment to exhibit behiavor z"

#Heuristics:
Do's: 1. Get out of the building/get away from the computer; 2. Think big, start small; 3. Choosoe differentiation vs. derivative; 4. Test your hypothesis; 5. Create and experiment with a Minimum Viable Product(MVP); 6. Be ever willing to change your thinking/idea (Don't be afraid to admit what you have sucks)
* Don't's: Believe "if you build it, they will come"(that only works in the movies); 2. Insist that it will "go viral"; 3. Think that you won't have competition; 4. Build a <insert product name> killer; 5. Rely on only needing a small percentage of a large market; 6. Confuse an idea with a company; 7. Insist that it has to be "cool"

## UX Design Overview
* About UX design: 1. is inherently creative/artistic, 2. very unpredictable, 3. user centred, 4. blends technical feasibility with creative sense (design and technology together--enbrace it), 5. creates a narrative for the user experience, 6. includes UI design, and so much more, 6. A process-not a state, 7. Non-hierarchical: Not bottom-up or top-down; 8. Radically transformational: agile/iterative/lean; prototyping is a must; 9. embracing discovery: New goals/features/ desires/wants/directions/scope; 10. Find out what users are trying to achieve; 11. What similar systems have they used that make them feel good using them; 12. Learn about the users' behaviors, motivations; 13. Get at the requirements of what needs to be designed;
* Think bigger than: "what's wrong with the current app/site?"

## UI vs. UX
* UX design is: 1. field research, user interviews, user testing; 2. gathering/organizing stats, creating personas; 3. creating user stories, creating customer journey maps; 4. product design, feature/requirements gathering; 5. graphic art, interaction design, information architecture; 6. Usability design/testing, prototryping, UI design/layout; 7. Visual design, taxonomy/terminology creation; 8. Copyrighting, presenting, integrating with S/W developers, 9. Brainstorming, design culture evangelism
* UX design vs. HCI: UX design is 1. adaptive vs predictive; 2. user centered (like agile methodology), 3. industry driven, 4. human centered practice. Human-Computer Interaction(HCI) is: 1. academic research driven, exploratory engineering, 2. cognitive science, attempts to formalize methodology, 3. predictive, not always with practical application

## Intro to Agile Methodology
* A methodology for project management. Usually in software engineering/development. But can be used in other disciplines
* characteristics: 1. emphasis on collaboration; 2. Self-organizing teams; 3. cross-functional teams: group memebers coming from different disciplines, eg. software engineers, UI desingers, UX designers, artists, etc; 4. adaptive planning ( inspect and adadpt philosophy); 5. embracing change--and postiively responding to it(even late in the process/project life cycle); 6. working towards early, or in the very least, on time delivery; 7. working product delivered frequently; 8. attention paid to design on all levels; 9. very short feedback loop, short daily meeting, adaption cycle; 10. user centered; 11. incremental; 12. frequent communication; 13. Deliveries are short-term: i.e.,1-4 weeks; 14. entire team is responsible for managing the team: not just the project manager's

##### Tools:

## Chapter 2: User Survey & Interview
* Before you start asking...: It is hard to ask questions when you don't know what you're looking for... Before you start coming up with your survey/interview questions, ask yourself what information are you looking for, and from whom? **What is your objective?**
* Types of questions: Two main types of questions: open ended, closed ended
* Open-ended: free flowing, not leading, usually at the ned of the survey
* closed ended: Three types. Rating scale, multiple choice, rank order
* Open-ended pro: give qualitative responses, discovery of new ideas, gives the "why" for a given topic
* Open-ended cons: Time consuming for respondent/analyze/compile data; 2. if done wrong (e.g., leading), answers may not be useful. Eg. "What is your opinion on social media" (This is leading)
* Closed-ended pros: quick; doesn't require a large amount of effort from the participant; good for showing quantitative data;
* Closed-ended cons: hard to dig deep and get meaningful information

### User Interview
* Why?: validation of product **Very important**, ask why...and keep asking it
* Common research technique: To gather qualitative info from existing/potential users
* Performed by one or two (two is best)
* questions cover topics such as users': background, occupation, use of technology, goals, motivations, pain points
* useful for: 1. later use in creating personas, 2. validating features, the product, the market
* How to find your interviewees? User group/Special Interest Groups (SIGs), analytics, market research, networking
* Create your interview script with questions you want to ask. And go over it yourself before conducting the interviews
* Tips on conducting user interviews: 1. Let interviewees know why you are interviewing them. 2. Don't ask leading questions. e.g.,(bad)"how often do you use Facebook", e.g.(good)"Do you use any social media networks"
* Use the script as a guide for questions. Not as a "bible", allow for improvisation within the interview--especially if the conversation goes into an interesting area
* Keep it to less than an hour: 20 minutes is plenty in small projects
* Leave time between interviews--it's an exhausting task
* one team member takes notes, one ask questions--taking notes is so very important! Bullet point is fine, be concise but get all of what's being said
* Record your interview. So that later you can go back and make further notes
* Perform the interview in an environment that's not distracting. No babies crying, sirens blaring, people interrupting, etc
* Dress to the level of the interviewee
* Make interviewee comfortable: Be cordial, offer refreshments if possible
* Keep it on track--don't let them go off on tangents: unless those tangents are relevant to the questions/product
* Maintain eye contact: Don't bury yourself in the notes

* The 5 Why's Techniques
* Protip: Instead of using "why", soften it with "what" or "how". It will seem less interrogation-like
* eg. Why do you eat out? vs. What's the reason for your eating out habits?

### Contextual Interview
* Interviewing potential/current users in the environment in which they will use the product
* Useful in determining: 1. distraction(i.e., possible pain point): noisy, interruptions, bad Wi-Fi signal, cramped, dark, hot, dusty; 2. Personality clues (ergo personas): e.g., messy environment, organized, dark, light, noisy, disruptive; 3. The technology: Type of computer (e.g.,mobile,laptop, desktop, etc);4. Workarounds: e.g., post its with instructions, USB memory stick, etc
* Analysis of Finding for Interviews: 1. After interviews, you should have: tons of notes, audio recordings; 2. Do the following: listen to the audio recording, and take notes; reread the notes taken, and annotate them; create mind maps

### Survey
* Survey help: offer quantitative results. (1. Validation of product...remember? 2. Most of the rest of UX winds up being qualitative)
* Online survey tools: SurveyMonkey, Typeform, JotForm, AskNicely, Formstack, Surveygizmo, Google Forms
* Offline tools: printed paper
* Process: 1. Clarify the purpose (i.e., what should be studied?) 2. Formulate survey goals: What are the aims? participants? Target population? How long? 3. Verify budget (i.e., time, money); 4. Choose survey method (i.e., online, offline), 5. Choose sampling (e.g., random, quota), 6. write and administer survey; 7. analyze and interpret survey results
* Screener questions: Because of the nature of survey, it is always a good idea to have screener questions. There are questions that help you weed out participants who are not in your target demographic. Questions like age, gender, profession, or whether or not they use certain products can all be suitable screener questions. Ideally you should have 1-3 screener questions in your survey.
* Survey online or offline?? Online benefit: Online tools offer many features, can tie in with social media, can reach large audience. Online shortcomings: If anonymous, majority of people contact won't respond. Offline benefits: It's harder to say "no" to a survey when handed on. That's social engineering. Offline shortcomings: Compile results can be very time consuming

### Rating Scale questions
* Two (commonly used) types: Likert-type, semantic differential
* Likert-type scales (ordinal): usually limited to a five-category scale, ordinal level
* Opinion and attitudes: "How much do you agree with..." possible answers: strongly agree, agree, neither agree or disagree, disagree, strongly disagree
* Frequency: "How often do you..." Possible answers: always, often, sometimes, rarely, never
* Quality: "In general, how do you rate the quality of..." Possible answers: excellent, very good, good, fair, poor
* Importance: "How important would you say {topic} is...": possible answers: very important, important, somewhat important, not at all important
* Semantic differential scales (ordinal or interval): 1. each end marked with opposing statements; 2. scale with an odd number of categories allow for neutrality (e.g., neither agree or disagree); 3. Scales with an even number of categories force respondents to make a choice: Called a "forced question"

#### Level of measurement
* Ratio: absolute zero (highest)
* Interval: distance is meaningful (2nd highest)
* Ordinal: attributes can be ordered (3rd highest)
* Nominal: attributes are only named; weakest

# Multiple Choice Questions
* select one or more answers from a list.
* Easy to answer, easy to compile/analyze results
* Special case of multiple choice: Dichotomous: choose one of two choices. Useful for determining if respondent is suited to responding to the next question--called a filter/contingency question. (Use filter questions sparingly!)
* e.g.: I enjoy eating ice cream at Fictionals. True/False. Do you like eating ice cream at Fictionals? Yes/No

# Rank Order
* Respondents must place each item in an order of: Importance/interest/prominence
* Useful to show what respondents like the most/least
* e.g., How would you rank the following pizza franchises? Press and hold your mouse on any franchise, and drag it up or down to change its rank. Pizza hut, papa John's. Little Ceasars. Domino's. Papa Murphy's

#### Question Wording
* Each question should have a defined focus. E.g., do you use Wi-Fi with your smart phone?
* Avoid: using double-negative, highly-emotional connotation
* Biased/leading questions--which can skew your results
* Be brief, concise
* Vary the types of questions--to increase engagement
* Be mindful of different interpretations of similar words

# Chapter 3: Personas, User Stories, DITL, Customer Journey Maps
* Organizing your data: So now that you have some data, now what?---We want to be able to identify themes and patterns in order to create a user persona

#### Affinity Diagram
* Affinity diagrams are a way of organizing large amounts of data froma variety of sources
* Uses mostly sticky notes (usually on some sort of whiteboard or clean wall)
* Can be done individually or as a team
* Start by writing your data down onto sticky notes (1 piece of data per sticky note)
* Set a timer for 5-10 minutes and start putting your post-it notes onto your wall: If this is done as a team, make sure no one is talking until the discussion part
* Organize common sticky notes together into group of 4 - 10 items (duplicates okay)
* As groups are formed, create a label (usually in a sticky note of a different color) and give a heading to your new group
* Do this until the timer runs out, then if you are in a team, discuss, and move sticky notes around as necessary
* Repeat as necessary
* A good tool to use online is Google's Jamboard

#### Personas
* What is a persona? An archetype of a type of user--an example of the type of person that would interact with the system (archetype: pattern of behavior)
* Not a hypothetical customer invented by the marketing
* Personas can span demographics
* They identify user motivations/expectations/goals
* They are fictional characters. But are based on real data and research of a problem domain
* Personas include: social/demographic characteristics; needs, desires, goals; cultural backgrounds, motivations, age, gender, occupation, hobbies; personalities; likes, dislikes; even a photo to bring the persona to life
* Personas answer very specific questions... Examples: Which information is necessary at which point of the day? Is the user concentrate on only one thing at a time? Does the user have frequent interruptions during their experience? Why is he/she using the product? What motivates him/her to use this specific product over a competitor's?
* Benefits of personas: Users' goals/needs become focus for team effort; each persona represents the needs of several/many users: focusing team's effort; relatively quick to develop; help avoid building what users ask for: instead of what they will actually use; prioritization can be done based on personas: e.g., the online persona, the HR persona, etc; reduce the frequency of usability tests
* Personas from research: Interviews, interviews, interviews... remember? Take the data from the interviews and: look for patterns of attitude and behavior.
