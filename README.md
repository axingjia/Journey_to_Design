* What is Design by Dieter Rams: Innovative, useful, aesthetic, understandable, unobstrusive, honest, long-lasting, thorough and thoughtful, environmentally friendly, less is more
* There is no such thing as an objectively good user interface: quality depends on the context: who the user is, what he/she is doing, what their motivation are; 2. Applying a set of one-size-fits-all principles makes user interface creation easier, but it **doesn't necessarily make the end result better**
* Bad design is easier to spot than good design: We mostly don't notice the good design--only when it's bad
