* Design is a way of communicating something to someone else through visual means.
* Text and image, typography and illustration,
* color and composition
* image, type, shape and color, composition
* To be a designer, you have to be a maker, either a maker of meaning or a maker of form, or preferably both.
* As a graphic designer, you have the power and responsibility of the ideas and objects that shape our culture. You will develop skills to create beautiful objects, make meaningful messages, to be persuasive, grow businesses, inspire emotional responses, and make ideas accessible to others. Graphic design is a dialogue with the world, leaving a record of that dialogue for later generations.
* Knowing how to create and deliver strong, compelling visual messages is beneficial for a person working in any field, from education to business to technology.
* Tools: illustrator, photoshop, InDesign
* Alternative: Scribus, Gimp and Lightscape

## Denotation and Connotation
* denotative and connotative image
* Denotation: it is what it is. A lot of denotation is getting to the essence of an image. Something where it's an object that has a range of possibilities, but also has a level of simplicity to the object.
* You can mix the message (a banana turning into apple; apple with orange inside)
* realistic and iconic
* techniques of imagemaking: there are literally hundreds of ways to make image.
* creative, inventive making
* You can probably find any kinds of image online
* we are interested in the process, instead of making the perfect image at the end
* Think how you can be clever and inventive and interesting as an image maker, rather than just being polished and refined
* line quality.
* you can just not use line and work with volume
* color
* what we are trying to get at here is how do you make an image that gets at the essence of your object?
* cropping: What is the closest that I can get to and still represent it as the object, versus, what is the furtherest that I can get from my object and still have it be recognizable.
* Experiment: Maybe try out new software, for other people it's getting more hands on skills and working off the computer
* Texture: pixel texture on digital,
* contrast
* Surprise yourself, make originality
* low tech: eg. scanner, photocopier
* process, generation, iteration; iteration: you make many images and compare them, but you will have to have two images to compare; generation: making as many objects as you can

#### Assignment:
* make at least 10 images of your object. Make each image with different techniques, and in a different way.
* To create your images, here are some materials you can consider: pencil, crayon charcoal, photograph, watercolor, color pencil, marker, collage, flat, illustrator drawing, scanned objects, clay, chalk, sculpture, found trash, scrapeboard, lino cut, monoprint, blind drawing, potato print, 3D model, photoshop manipulation, ballpoint pen in one continuous line
* Also think about what kind of imagemaking aesthetics or strategies you might employ: any historical design or art movement; cartoon, realistic, surreal, symbol/icon, impressionistic, abstract, historical, complex, minimal, cubist, decorative
* connotative: how image evokes in addition to their literal meaning
